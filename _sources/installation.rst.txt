Installation
############

DeepQuest is written in Python and we highly recommend that you use a Conda_ in order to keep under control your working environment, without interfering with your system-wide configuration, neither former installation of dependencies.

Assuming you are working in a dedicated Python environment, get DeepQuest as follows::

    git clone https://github.com/sheffieldnlp/deepQuest.git
    cd deepQuest
    conda install theano
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Computational Requirements
**************************

DeepQuest is GPU compatible and we highly recommend to train your models on GPU with a minimum of 8Go memory available.
Of course, if you don't have access to such resources, you can also use DeepQuest on a CPU server.
This will considerably extend the training time, especially for complex architecture, such as the POSTECH model (`Kim et al., 2017`_), on large datasets, but architectures such as BiRNN should work fine and take about 12 hours to be trained (while ~20min on GPU).
